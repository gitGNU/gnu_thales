Support for other ircds :
=========================
Most of the people using GNU Thales use it with the Unreal IRCD. However, from
time to time, people want to use it with another IRCD, which might be
unsupported. We can't afford to port Thales to all known IRCDs. But if you are
interested in porting Thales to another IRCD, we can help you :
- By giving you cvs commit access to the Repository at savannah.gnu.org.
- By helping you understand the current codebase.

Don't hesitate to contact us for more info.
