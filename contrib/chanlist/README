Hello, here's an example of how to make a PHP page that uses thales to
list all the currently active channels on your IRC network.  You will need
to do a bit of customising of the PHP file in some hopefully obvious places.

You can see an example of this working at http://blitzed.org/channels.phtml,
and if you have no idea what to do at all you can mail your questions to
me, grifferz@blitzed.org.  But I don't have a lot of time to support this
so please don't expect me to rewrite it for you -- it is provided as an
example mainly.

I would, however, love to know if you improve it.

Hope it is helpful to you,
Andy Smith <grifferz@blitzed.org>
