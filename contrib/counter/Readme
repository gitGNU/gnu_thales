///////////////////////
This is the Thales based IRC user counter
It works like a hit counter on web pages, but with irc & thales.
To see it working, you can point your browser to
http://www.dwchat.net/tools/thales/compteur.php?chan=dwchat&skin=1 
(for the direct html output)
or to 
http://www.dwchat.net/tools/thales/compteur_js.php?chan=dwchat&skin=1 
(for the non-php aware hosting services).

This script is based on digits2imgs script delivered with thales too.
(i admit this script is a bit useless :0).

So, to use it, you will have to configure the MySQL & site variables to fit your
environnement. That's to say, the mysql host, user, pass & database,
and the "webpath" to pictures (http://www.dwchat.net/pictures for example).
