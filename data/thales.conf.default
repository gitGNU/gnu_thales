# Configuration file for Thales.
#
# The format of this file is fairly simple: a line beginning with a # is a
# comment, and any other non-blank line is expected to be a directive and
# parameters, separated by spaces or tabs.  For example:
#
#   Directive Parameter-1 Parameter-2 ...
#
# Directives are case-insensitive.  Note that some directives do not take
# any parameters; these are typically "on-off" directives, for which simply
# including the directive in this file (or removing it) has an effect on
# Services' functionality.
#
# If a parameter's value is a string which includes spaces, enclose the
# string in double quotation marks, like the example below.  Quotes may be
# used around any string at all for clarity.
#
#   "This is a parameter string with spaces in it"
#
# If you need to include a double quote inside a quoted string, precede it
# by a backslash:
#
#   "This string has \"double quotes\" in it"
#
# Time parameters can be specified either as an integer representing a
# number of seconds (e.g. "3600" = 1 hour), or as an integer with a unit
# specifier: "s" = seconds, "m" = minutes, "h" = hours, "d" = days.
# Combinations (such as "1h30m") are not permitted.  Examples (all of which
# represent the same length of time, one day):
#
#   "86400", "86400s", "1440m", "24h", "1d"
#
# In the documentation for each directive, one of the following will be
# included to indicate whether an option is required:
#
# [REQUIRED]
#     Indicates a directive which must be given.  Without it, Services will
#     not start.
#
# [RECOMMENDED]
#     Indicates a directive which may be omitted, but omitting it may cause
#     undesirable side effects.
#
# [OPTIONAL]
#     Indicates a directive which is optional.  If not given, the feature
#     will typically be disabled.  If this is not the case, more
#     information will be given in the documentation.
#
# [DISCOURAGED]
#     Indicates a directive which may cause undesirable side effects if
#     specified.
#
# [DEPRECATED]
#     Indicates a directive which will disappear in a future version of
#     Services, usually because its functionality has been either
#     superseded by that of other directives or incorporated into the main
#     program.

# Remote server configuration
#
###########################################################################

# RemoteServer <hostname> <port> <password>  [REQUIRED]
#     Specifies the remote server hostname and port.  The hostname may
#     either be a standard Internet hostname or dotted-quad numeric
#     address; the port number must be an integer between 1 and 65535
#     inclusive.  The password is a string which should be enclosed in
#     double quotes if it contains any spaces (or just for clarity).

RemoteServer    localhost 6667 "mypass"

# LocalAddress <hostname> [port]  [OPTIONAL]
#     Specifies the local address to bind to before connecting to the
#     remote server.  This may be useful on multihomed hosts.  The hostname
#     and port number are specified the same way as with the RemoteServer
#     directive.  If this is not specified, Thales will let the operating
#     system choose the local address.  If only a hostname is specified,
#     Thales will bind to that address but let the operating system
#     choose the local port number.
#
#     If you don't know what this means or don't need to use it, just leave
#     the directive commented out.

#LocalAddress   nowhere. 0

ServerName  "thales.lucas.in"

# ServerDesc <text>  [REQUIRED]
#     Specifies the text which should appear as the server's information in
#     /whois and similar queries.  May be overridden by the -desc
#     command-line option.

#     Should probably stay "localhost"

MysqlServer  "localhost"

# MysqlDatabase <name>  [REQUIRED]
#     Specifies the name of the MySQL database you want to store data in.
#     The Database must exist, and the user specified below must have enough
#     access to it.

MysqlDatabase "thales"

# MysqlUser <name> [REQUIRED]
#     Username to use when connecting to MySQL

MysqlUser "lucas"

# MysqlPassword <password> [REQUIRED]

# Cache configuration
#
###########################################################################

# Thales is now able to keep nicknames and servers in the tables after they
# quit/split. Using this feature, you can add a "last seen" function to your
# web WHOIS system.
# To disable this feature, set ServerCacheTime and UserCacheTime to 0 (that's
# the default)

# Number of seconds during which we must keep servers in the server table.
# Since servers split are uncommon, we keep them for a week.

#ServerCacheTime 604800
ServerCacheTime 0

# How often (in seconds) to we check for obsoleted servers ?

ServerCleanFreq 60480

# Number of seconds during which we must keep users in the user table.
# Since users connect/disconnect are very common, we don't keep them for a
# long time. 2 days looks reasonnable.

#UserCacheTime 172800
UserCacheTime 0

# How often (in seconds) to we check for obsoleted users ?

UserCleanFreq 3600

# PRIVACY SETTING : Hide +k channels' passwords in the chan table
