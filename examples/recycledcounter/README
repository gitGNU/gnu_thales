Recycled-counter, the counter that you recycle ;)
ProPheT <prophet@recycled-irc.org>
-----------------------
This is a Thales based graphical counter
It can display the number of users on the network, the number of channels and the number of users on au specific channel.
Edit recycpt.php to change connection information ($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass and $db_name)
This script produces a single image that you can use like all PNG images
http://www.your.site/dir/recycpt.php display the number of users
http://www.your.site/dir/recycpt.php?type=nbchan display the number of channels
http://www.your.site/dir/recycpt.php?chan=disku display the number of users on the channel #disku
http://www.your.site/dir/recycpt.php?texte=yes display the number of users in text (to use it in an other script)

you can change the colour of the output by giving bg and fg arguments
recycpt.php?bg=X&fg=Y
X = background RGB colour in decimal
Y = foreground RGB colour in decimal
